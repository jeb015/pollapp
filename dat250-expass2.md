First I made the Java Beans I needed, then I set up the tests in Bruno. After that I started working on the handlers and methods, 
struggled a little bit, but didn't take long nor did i encounter any particular issues.
I have the base functionallities, but there are several checks that should exist and I need better tracking for who did what and when.
